Google cloud platform fundamentals
LAB:Getting started with compute engine

objectives
Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

Connect between the two instances.


Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console
steps

to create the virtual machine with the name my-vm-1 input the command below
    .gcloud beta compute --project=qwiklabs-gcp-04-7af4d2812daa instances create my-vm-1 
    --zone=us-central1-a --machine-type=e2-medium --subnet=default --network-tier=PREMIUM

to create the firewall rule to allow http    
    gcloud compute --project=qwiklabs-gcp-04-7af4d2812daa firewall-rules create default-allow-http
     --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=default --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:80
      --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags=http-server


Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line
steps
To display a list of all the zones in the region
    gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

To set your default zone to the one you want  enter the command
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b   
    
To create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone, execute this command:
  gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"

Connect between VM instances
steps
Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-2
     ssh my-vm-2
Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

ping my-vm-1

Notice that the output of the ping command reveals that the complete hostname of my-vm-1 is 
my-vm-1.c.PROJECT_ID.internal, where PROJECT_ID is the name of your Google Cloud Platform project. 

Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:

     ssh my-vm-1

If you are prompted about whether you want to continue connecting to a host with unknown authenticity,
 enter yes to confirm that you do.

At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

       sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

      sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. 
Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

Hi from YOUR_NAME

Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.

Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, 
execute this command:

     curl http://localhost/

The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

    exit

You will return to the command prompt on my-vm-2

to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2,
 execute this command:

   curl http://my-vm-1/

The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, 
including your line of custom text.
